    "# Collecting Real Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's time to actually collect some data!\n",
    "\n",
    "You've been given a small ESP32-S2 microcontroller and a \"shield\" or \"hat\" board that can be attached to the microcontroller. If the boards are not already attached you can connect them. Make sure the 10-13 and 15-17 pins match between the two boards.\n",
    "\n",
    "[add a picture here showing the correct alignment]\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these are connected, attach the microcontroller to your computer. You should see an external drive mount itself with the name \"Circuit Python\" (not sure this is spelled correctly! Check...)\n",
    "\n",
    "To program the microcontroller you'll need to download an editor. I've been using \n",
    "[Thonny](https://thonny.org/), which I recommend, but there are others as well. For the purpose of this workshop, let's use Thonny so we're all on the same page. You'll be keeping your microcontroller, so you can experiment with others later if you like!\n",
    "\n",
    "To control the output pins of the microcontroller and measure voltages we'll also be using python, but it's a slightly different version of python than the one we're using to analyze the data. This version runs on the microcontroller, and it's called [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/). In addition to standard python syntax, and some standard python libraries, it also includes libraries that enable one to access the pins of the microcontroller to control and measure voltages, or to communicate with standard protocols (e.g., $i^2c$, `SPI`, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example there is library called `analogio` that includes methods to read voltage values using analog to digital converters (ADCs) on the microcontroller. The ESP32-S2 also has two digital to analog converters (DACs) that can be used to control voltages as well. The DACs on the ESP32-S2 are eight bit DACs, so they have 255 different output levels. The voltage range is very roughly 0-3.3V. The ADCs on the ESP32-S2 are 12-bit devices, but they have a more limited voltage range. They can only measure up to about 2.5V.\n",

    "On the ESP32-S2 pins 10, 13, and 15 can be used to measure analog voltages using ADCs, while pin 17 can be used either as a DAC output, or a digital (binary HIGH/LOW) output.\n",

    "# Experiment 1: Ohm's Law\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment uses the approach described in [Modeling and Visualizing](ModelingVisualizing.ipynb) to \"measure\" the value of R3 using Ohm's Law. Of course we *know* it's a 2K resistor from the schematic, but you could frame this as an unknown for your students.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure a voltage from a particular pin we need to use the `board` library to get a pin object, and the `analogio` library to construct analog input objects. Each analog input object corresponds to a specific pin on the microcontroller that is identified using the board library as shown below:\n",

    "    a10 = aio.AnalogIn(board.IO10)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then to actually carry out a measurement we need to access the `value` property of the analog input object for any particular pin. For example the following statment would save the current value of the a15 analog input object in a variable name v15:\n",
    "\n",
    "    v15 = a15.value\n",
    "\n",
    "To control the output of a DAC we need to create an analog output object:\n",
    "\n",
    "    dac = aio.AnalogOut(board.IO17)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to set the voltage on the pin one can set the `value` propery like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "    dac.value = 0  # set dac low\n",
    "\n",
    "So the plan is pretty simple. Write a loop to set the voltage on pin-17, and measure the voltages on pin-15 and pin-10.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Establish an empty list to contain the results of the measurements.\n",
    "2. Set up a loop to iterate over output voltages.\n",
    "3. For each iteration\n",
    "    * set the voltage on pin-17\n",
    "    * wait a bit for the circuit to settle (note the capacitor)\n",
    "    * measure the voltages on pins 10 and 13\n",
    "    * save the values in the list after each measurement\n",

    "Before we let loose and start collecting data there's one additional aspect we need to discuss. CircuitPython runs on over 500 different microcontrollers with many different features. In order for code that's written on one device to have a chance of working correctly on another device the ADCs and DACs don't use the raw input and output values, but rather they use scaled values with a minimum of zero and a maximum of an unsigned 16-bit integer ($2^{16}-1$) or 65535. This means we need to scale the values we read from ADCs and write to the DACs accordingly. Here's an example showing one way to do this. We'll go over this example in detail during the workshop.\n",
