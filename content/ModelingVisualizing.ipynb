    "Suppose we set up the circuit shown in Fig. 1 below. We can set the source voltage, and we have a known resistance of $1\\  {\\rm k}\\Omega$ in series with an unknown resistance. The idea is to set the source voltage to a series of values and at each value, measure the voltage at the junction between the known and unknown resistance. We can then compute the current through the known resistor, and assuming the voltage measurement draws very little current, assume that this current is the same as the current in the unknown resistance. Then, using the voltage across and the current through the unknown resistor estimate its resistance using Ohm's Law: $V = I R$.\n",
